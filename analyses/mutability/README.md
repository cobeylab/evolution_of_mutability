## Python scripts to implement mutability metrics ##

This folder contains python scripts used by the analysis scripts to compute the mutability of B cell receptor sequences based on their nucleotide motifs. Files with the mutability scores from the S5F model (```Yaari_fivemer_scores.csv```) and the 7-mer model (```Elhanati_files/```) are included. The ```mutability_function.py``` script further defines WRCH/DGYW hotspots and defines functions for computing sequence mutability based on the different metrics and a list of partition points defining FRs and CDRs. Partition points for each dataset are stored in ```partition_points.py``` as a dictionary of lists. Elements 1-6 in each list (in human numbering, not Python numbering) list the first nucleotide of FRs and CDRs 1-3. The remaining element lists the last nucleotide of CDR 3.
