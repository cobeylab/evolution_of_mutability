#Tree annotation#
Things to note:

The BEAST MCC trees sometimes have ambiguous sequence reconstructions at some nodes. Each node is annotated with the set of reconstructions found in the trees used to obtain the MCC tree, along with the posterior probability of each reconstruction (presumably as determined by its frequency in the sample). When the highest posterior probability corresponds to more than one reconstruction, the reconstruction at the node is represented in the form 

'VRC01\_01_\final\_alignment.CP2="ATATTACGCATAACGCCT[...]+ATATTACGCATAACGCCT[...
]".

In the analysis of MCC trees, I arbitrarily chose the first possible reconstruction (i.e. before the first '+') in all such instances.

As for the other analyses involving mutability, we ignored a weird VRC26 sequence whose CDR 2 consisted entirely of gaps (genBank accession KJ134124).
